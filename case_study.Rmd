```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
library(tidyverse)
data(nyc_airbnb)
```

```{r}
nyc_airbnb = nyc_airbnb |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(borough = neighbourhood_group) |> 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location/2)
```

## Brainstorm questions 
- Where are airbnbs expensive
  - borough? neighborhood?
  - do other factors affect price? what about rating?
- How long are airbnbs active?
  - illegal? shut down?
- which units have the most availabilities?
- how is review score impacted by location?
- how many apts are run by on host? 

## Exploring the data 
```{r}
ggplot(nyc_airbnb, aes(x = borough, y = price)) + geom_point()
```
